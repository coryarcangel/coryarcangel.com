The videos where generated in real-time by the game controllers being hot wired (by the Video Game TIVO TM chip), so, the games were actually being played in real time by a kinda mini computer. Though, of course, the games that were being ‚Äúplayed‚Äù into the controllers were all losing games of straight gutter balls. Anyway. I have uploaded some video re-scans of the work above.

Schoenberg‚Äôs Op11 is often considered the first piece of ‚Äúatonal‚Äù music, or music to completely break from traditional western harmony which means it‚Äôs not written in a ‚Äúkey‚Äù. Below you will find the three videos (one for each piano piece), a technical description &amp; the score.

For this project I used some programs to help me save time in finding the right cats. Anyway, first I downloaded every video of a cat playing piano I could find on Youtube. I ended up with about 170 videos. Then I extracted the audio from each, pasted these files end to end, and then pasted this huge file onto the end of an audio file of Glenn Gould playing op11. I loaded this file into <a title="""" href=""http://www.comparisonics.com/"">Comparisonics</a>. Comparisonics, a strange free program I found while surfing one night, allows users to highlight a section of audio, and responds by finding ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù sounding areas in rest of the audio file. Using Comparisioncs I went through every ‚Äúnote‚Äù (sometimes I also did clusters of notes) in the Gould, then selected my favorite ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù section Comparisonics suggested and wrote it in the score. After going though the 1000‚Äôs of ‚Äúnotes‚Äù, the completed scores were turned into a video by some perl scripts I wrote. See the ‚ÄúGould Pro‚Äù code below. For those out there in Internet land wondering how close cats could actually come to Gould playing Schoenberg, <a href=""http://www.coryarcangel.com/downloads/op11_comparison_web.mp3"">check this mp3</a>, I have placed my cats in the left channel and Gould in the right channel. Listen with headphones. It‚Äôs not so far off I think.

 Score The file format is: youtube filehash ‚Äì comma ‚Äì sample number at 44100 samples per second where the in point of video is ‚Äì comma ‚Äì sample number at 44100 samples per second of the clip length. In this <a href=""http://www.coryarcangel.com/downloads/op11_score_linenumbers-web.pdf"">pdf here</a> I have provided the key as to which youtube files line up with what notes in Schoenberg. The Schoenberg score has line numbers written below its notes which correspond to the line numbers from the 3 score txt files below.

It takes about 8 hours for the blocks to fall in one complete game. At the same time, it is still possible to move them left and right, it just takes minutes for them to drop one pixel down on the screen. It's totally maddening! This I guess is a theme in a few of the things I have made which are interactive (see related works below for other upsetting interactive stuff). Also of note, for NES nerds out there, this was a binary hack, as the delay loop was written by hand in 6502 binary!
