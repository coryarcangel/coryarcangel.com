<b>About me:</b> Hi, Im Cory Arcangel. Welcome 2 my official portfolio website ✌️ I'm a composer, artist, writer, curator, [aspiring youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/user/coryarcangel), etc, etc, living in Stavanger, Norway. 
<br> 
<b>About this site:</b> This site is powered by [Jekyll running from .csv files](https://github.com/coryarcangel/coryarcangel.com-2021), and compiled locally. My old [site](https://conifer.rhizome.org/cory_arcangel/coryarcangelcom/20211205113448/https://coryarcangel.com) was blasted by malware (2021 couldn't have been any worse!), so I slapped this together in a hurry after extracting some of the SQL and trying my best to maintain the old url structure. You can follow my journey learning web programming again after 25 years [here](https://www.are.na/cory-arcangel/web-programming-vbyqgtju2y4) at Are.na ❤️.
