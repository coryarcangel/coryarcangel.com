About me: Hi, Im Cory Arcangel. Welcome 2 my official portfolio website ✌️ I'm a composer, artist, writer, curator, [aspiring youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/user/coryarcangel), etc, etc, living in Stavanger, Norway. 
<br> 
About this site: This site is powered by [Jekyll running from .csv files](https://github.com/coryarcangel/coryarcangel.com-2021), and compiled locally. My old [site](https://conifer.rhizome.org/cory_arcangel/coryarcangelcom/20211205113448/https://coryarcangel.com/) was blasted by malware (2021 couldn't have been any worse!), so I slapped this together in a hurry (2 days) after extracting some of the SQL and trying my best to maintain the old url structure. Bare with me, lotsa broken links still :-/
