<b>About me:</b> OMG, you made it here ... a mil thx 4 stopping by ✌️ As for me, I'm a composer, artist, curator, writer, teacher, [aspiring youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/user/coryarcangel)↪, etc, etc, living in Stavanger, Norway.

<b>About this site:</b> This site is powered by [Jekyll running from .csv files](https://github.com/coryarcangel/coryarcangel.com-2021)↪, last updated {{ site.time | date: '%d/%m/%y' }}, and compiled locally. My old [site](https://conifer.rhizome.org/cory_arcangel/coryarcangelcom/20211205113448/https://coryarcangel.com/)↪ was blasted by malware (2021 couldn't have been any worse!), so I slapped this together in a hurry after extracting some of the SQL and trying my best to maintain the old url structure. You can follow my journey learning web programming again after 25 years [here](https://www.are.na/cory-arcangel/web-programming-swlfeldb7o)↪ at Are.na️.
