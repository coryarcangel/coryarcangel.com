<b>About me:</b> Hi. Thx 4 the 👀. I'm a [composer](https://hiddennoise.org/){:target="_blank"}↪, [artist](../things-i-made/){:target="_blank"}↪, [curator](https://www.kunsthallesanktgallen.ch/en/exhibition/959/ALLIEATINADAY2024){:target="_blank"}↪, [writer](https://www.are.na/editorial/the-north-face){:target="_blank"}↪, [teacher](https://uit.no/studiesteder/kabelvag/filmkunstskolen)↪, [aspiring youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/user/coryarcangel)↪, etc, etc, living in Stavanger, Norway.  
<b>About this site:</b> This site is powered by [Jekyll running from .csv files](https://github.com/coryarcangel/coryarcangel.com-2021){:target="_blank"}↪, last updated {{ site.time | date: '%d/%m/%y' }}, and compiled locally. My old [site](https://conifer.rhizome.org/cory_arcangel/coryarcangelcom/20211205113448/https://coryarcangel.com/){:target="_blank"}↪ was blasted by malware (2021 couldn't have been any worse!), so I slapped this together in a hurry after extracting some of the SQL and trying my best to maintain the old url structure. You can follow my journey learning web programming again after 25 years [here](https://www.are.na/cory-arcangel/web-programming-swlfeldb7o){:target="_blank"}↪ at Are.na️.
