pitch: First time I showed Various Self Playing Bowling Games....on 14 screens. :)
ps: This show was the first time I showed the monster Various Self Playing Bowling
  Games. It wz partially commissioned by the Barbican, and was shown here as 14 screens
  (ps - It wz a miracle they all worked for the duration of the exhibition). LOL.
  Also, since there was only one work in the show, I was stupid to give the show a
  different title then the work. That's why Various Self Playing Bowling Games often
  gets mis-titled Beat the Champ.
