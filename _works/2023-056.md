pitch: 21-11-2023-11-31-35-input_gb-po-1913 borrows from an image of the cubist painting
  by George Braque's Violin and Sheet Music on a Table (Petit Oiseau). Keeping the
  same ratio of the original work, and employing a technique referred to as "deep
  frying", Arcangel has written code to recursively tweak an image using common image
  manipulation techniques such as compression, re-sizing, and modulation. Arcangel's
  manipulation of the ​original source material ultimately reaches a transformational
  breaking point surfacing new representational possibilities​ at the intersection
  of figuration and abstraction.
