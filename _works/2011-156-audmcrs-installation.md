title: The AUDMCRS Underground Dance Music Collection of Recorded Sound
year: '2012'
display_year: '2011'
medium: '800+ trance records, MARC formatted database. '
dims: Variable
pitch: "​Professionally archived collection of trance records."
ps: ​This is a collection of about 900 or so trance records I acquired from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Topolsky"
  target="_blank">a retired trance DJ</a> in 2011. The records were professionally
  cataloged and archived over the course of a year. Each record was bar coded, and
  these bar codes provided the inventory numbers tying them into a MARC standard database,
  as well as a hi-resolution database images of each record. This “collection” is
  toured. ps - I made a website for it as well.
