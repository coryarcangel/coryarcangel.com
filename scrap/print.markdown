International Business Machines

<h1>International Business Machines↴</h1>
International Business Machines (working title) is the first mid-career retrospective of contemporary artist Cory Arcangel (1978, Buffalo, New York). Aimed at a broad audience and attendance minded, International Business Machines will feature 25 years of the artist’s work and will be centered around several of the artist’s (now) canonical immersive video and carpet installations such as <a href="https://coryarcangel.com/things-i-made/2002-001-super-mario-clouds">Super Mario Clouds (2002)</a>, <a href="https://coryarcangel.com/things-i-made/2002-002-i-shot-andy-warhol">I Shot Andy Warhol (2003)</a>, <a href="https://coryarcangel.com/things-i-made/2012-066-working-on-my-novel">Working on My Novel (2009)</a>, <a href="https://coryarcangel.com/things-i-made/2014-152-photoshop-cs">Adobe Photoshop Gradients (2007-ongoing)</a>, and  <a href="https://rodeo.computer/">/roʊˈdeɪoʊ/ Let's Play: HOLLYWOOD, 2017-2021</a>. The show will also feature the debut of a major new body of work.

In a modern world covered in screens, awash in alerts, and soon to be eaten by AI, now is the time to reflect on <i>what the hell is going on</i>. Positioned to address the “now” perhaps as effectively as any artist of his generation, Arcangel spent the past quarter century — since 2000 — playing with the potential and failures of old and new digital technologies, highlighting their obsolescence, humor, aesthetic attributes and eerie influence in contemporary life. Furthermore there has never been a retrospective of an artist whose studio and primary venue is “virtual”. Therefore International Business Machines will introduce the public to an entirely new model of what such a retrospective can look like. Unlike a trad show, which mainly involves moving crates around the globe, IBM ;-) will be performative in nature (all things digital are being “performed” in real time through devices with the aid of electricity), and will span IRL, virtual, and concert venues. Each “performance” of a work will be bespoke to the venue. Lastly, Arcangel — having spent the past 25 years publishing, and performing his work online — has a broad multi-generational global audience to pull from.
