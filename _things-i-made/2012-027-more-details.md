ps: So yeah, this was just some tic tacs thrown under the front seat of a Mercedes,..
  it wz in a show at MOCA LA (curated by Mike D!) I think it is my personal highlight
  of 2012. If you have a Mercedes and are interested in this work - aka having some
  tic tacs thrown under your front seat - please contact me using the contact on the
  ABOUT page of this site. Thanks and looking forward to hearing from you ! :)
