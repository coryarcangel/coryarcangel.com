pitch: "<p>​Gif file written by hand. </p>"
ps: |-
  <p>​Handmade Gif is a Gif file I wrote by hand in binary. This of course is pointless, but I chose to do this as an exercise in order to familiarize myself with the basics of compression for no reason other then I wondered how it worked. Since Gif was the oldest common compression format, I picked it first. And because I was writing it by hand I picked a really small and easy one to do, which was a 2 pixel wide by 2 pixel high square. Black, White, on top of White, Black. U can see it re-sized above (the grey sections are aliasing which are not included in the oriignal, ... I swear!, download it and check it out. :) </p>
