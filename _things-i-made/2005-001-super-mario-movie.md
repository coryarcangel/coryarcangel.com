pitch: "​15 minute movie programmed onto a Mario Brothers cartridge."
ps: "​First check out the ROM below. You can load this up in a NES emulator to watch
  this movie. It’s better then the youtube, trust me! Also it’s legit. Also, check
  the related code section for a full blast of the entire working archive of the code
  for this project. Also buried in the code and its versions are bits of script (which
  we had been working on sporadically for a few years) and other loose ends. For the
  NES heads out there, the code also might be of interest because it contains a very
  simple built from scratch music sequencer, a rudimentary animation engine, and an
  RLE scheme to compress backgrounds."
