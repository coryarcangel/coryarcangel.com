pitch: 'In Identity Pitches, Cory Arcangel and Stine Janvin have composed a conceptual
  music scores based on the knitting patterns for traditional Norwegian sweaters known
  as Lusekofte. Janvin creates scores for both solo and ensemble performers by mapping
  three classic Lusekofte designs onto the harmonic and subharmonic series. These
  scores, which integrate the tuning principles of Norwegian folk instruments, are
  further manipulated by Arcangel using a “deep-fried” coding script to create an
  alternative series of compressed, detuned glitches and images. '
