pitch: <p>PS1 "Bowling" game programmed to roll endless gutter balls via a modded
  controller.</p>
ps: <p>​This was only the second "Self Playing Game" I ever made. Note the early design
  of the Video Game TIVO TM. If you check out a later work, like Various Self Playing
  Bowling Games, you can see the final version of the TIVO. This was still in the
  middle of R + D on that device. </p>
