pitch: "​Kurt Cobain’s suicide letter with Google ads placed on it."
ps: "​A while back, I made a web page which paired Kurt Cobain’s suicide letter with
  Google Ads (google ads are generated from the text of the page they appear on).
  It was up for a while but after getting digged google decided to remove the ads
  from the page. I took some screen shots while it was up and above are two examples
  of what it looked like."
