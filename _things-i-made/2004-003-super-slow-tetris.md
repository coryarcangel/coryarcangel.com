pitch: "<p>​Tetris screwed.</p>"
ps: <p>​This was originally called "Tetris Screwed". It takes about 8 hours for the
  blocks to fall in one complete game. At the same time, it is still possible to move
  them left and right, it just takes minutes for them to drop one pixel down on the
  screen. It's totally maddening! This I guess is a theme in a few of the things I
  have made which are interactive (see related works below for other upsetting interactive
  stuff). Also of note, for NES nerds out there, this was a binary hack, as the delay
  loop was written by hand in 6502 binary! Step to that!</p>
