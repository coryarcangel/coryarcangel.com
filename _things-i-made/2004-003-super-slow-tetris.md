title: Super Slow Tetris
year: '2004'
display_year: '2004'
medium: Modded Tetris game cartridge
dims: Dimensions variable
pitch: "​Tetris screwed."
ps: ​This was originally called "Tetris Screwed". It takes about 8 hours for the blocks
  to fall in one complete game. At the same time, it is still possible to move them
  left and right, it just takes minutes for them to drop one pixel down on the screen.
  It's totally maddening! This I guess is a theme in a few of the things I have made
  which are interactive (see related works below for other upsetting interactive stuff).
  Also of note, for NES nerds out there, this was a binary hack, as the delay loop
  was written by hand in 6502 binary! Step to that!
