pitch: Brochure with 8 free prints included. Edition unknown (a few thousand?).
ps: A brochure made for a show I did @ the Whitney Museum called Pro Tools. This was
  also kinda the take away "catalog" for the show, aka it wz free and available at
  the exhibition. The idea here was we made two versions, one for the web (download
  below) and one that was printable. If you have download the below PDF and r wondering
  why it seemed backwards, that’s cause it is designed to be printed out all at once
  on a desktop printer, and then folded along the center length wise, after which
  it will turn into a small booklet. In the version of the brochure which wz at the
  Whitney, since it was printed by a professional printer which has the ability to
  print on the backs of pages, I had the back of each page be a Photoshop Gradient.
  Therefore you will notice the brochure at the Whitney has no staple, … anyway, during
  the show ppl didn't seem to get this brochure had 8 free lithos in them, so more
  power to whoever took them and kept them. :)
