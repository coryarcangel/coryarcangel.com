ps: |-
  ​​For a few years, 4 every show I did I had free CD takeaways with music on them (or were they 5$?, I can't remember). This CD was both given away, and played during a show I

  did at the Migros museum in 2005. The music was an improvisation on a Nintendo NES music sequencer I was working on at the time, and which would eventually power the music in a vid I made that year called Super Mario Movie.&nbsp; :)
