ps: "<p>For this one, I have remastered - from a 78 - a recording of Beethoven’s Symphony
  No. 3 in E Flat Major (“Eroica”), Op. 55 by the NBC Symphony Orchestra. This original
  source is important, as it seems it is the only way to hear the very famous coughs
  which have been editing out of modern versions of this recording. My newly remastered
  digital file - coughs included - is played on an iPod through a new lifestyle product
  called the XL Model Geneva Lab GenevaSound Stereo.</p>"
