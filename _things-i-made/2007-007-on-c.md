pitch: "​Essay describing the mathematics behind Jpegs."
ps: ​A pdf explanation of why Jpegs look the way they do. This kinda document is pretty
  common in computer science departments although this one is kinda more for “noobs”
  as I show the math in greater detail. Possibly of note is it being <a href="http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/on_compression/">republished
  as a one page Jpg of itself on the Frieze website</a>. This was first published
  in my book (made by the wonderful Dexter Sinister) a couple thousand short films
  by glenn gould.
