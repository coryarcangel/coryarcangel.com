pitch: "<p>​La Monte Young's Composition #7 as a guitar hero style game.</p>"
ps: '<p>​This is a mod file for the desktop game Frets on Fire, which is an open source
  version of Guitar Hero. Below you can download the mod files, to be placed in the
  Frets on Fire song folder. This will allow you to play this game on your own version
  of Frets On Fire. For those not in the know, Composition #7 calls for two notes
  to be held for "a long time". For this game, "a long time" was defined as the classic
  length of a pop song. About 4 minutes. </p>'
