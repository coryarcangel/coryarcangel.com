pitch: "​Mod of Hogan’s Alley video game where one is asked to shoot Andy Warhol."
ps: 'This is a Hogan’s Alley mod, where the gangsters have been replaced by Warhol,
  and the “innocents” have been replaced by the Pope, Flavor Flav (pre MTV show!!!!),
  and Col Sanders (note: Col Sanders was actually real person). So enjoy!, and please
  check below for the ROM which you can download, and in order 2 play this at home.
  pps - there is no source code to this project, because it is a “rom hack” aka all
  the modifications r done directly in the binary of the compiled ROM. Both the graphics
  and the program are modified for this project. The graphics are changed to add the
  new characters (duh!), and the program is changed to switch the mirroring of the
  sprites which compose the characters faces. For example Flavor Flav’s face is not
  symmetrical where as Col sanders’ face is.'
