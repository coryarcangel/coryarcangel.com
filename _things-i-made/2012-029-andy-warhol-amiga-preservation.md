pitch: Worked with a super chill team to discover and preserve Andy Warhol’s Amiga
  1000 experiments.
ps: Not exactly a “thing i made”, more like a “thing i produced”, but none the less,
  ... my fav project of all time.There iz a really great documentary on the project
  linked above. Def watch, and read the great accompanying text – The Warhol Files
  – if you got an extra 20 min lying around some day. Will give you a good idea of
  the 3 year process that went into this. ;)
