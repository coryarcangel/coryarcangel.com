pitch: "​Bowling games from the history of video games programmed to bowl only gutter
  balls via modded controllers."
ps: Sooo,.....this was a miltiscreen commission by both the Whitney Museum in NY and
  the Barbican art space in London with the idea that it would show in both places.
  Because of the difference in the two spaces it ended up showing as two different
  sizes. At the Barbican it was 14 screens(!), and at the Whitney it was 6 screens.
  The videos where generated in real-time by the game controllers being hot wired
  (by the Video Game TIVO TM chip), so, the games were actually being played in real
  time by a kinda mini computer. Though, of course, the games that were being “played”
  into the controllers were all losing games of straight gutter balls. Anyway. I have
  uploaded some video re-scans of the work above. Also possibly of note, it took me
  9 months to made this and get it all straight, and it almost killed me! LOL.
