title: Space Invader
year: '2004'
display_year: '2004'
medium: Modded Space Invaders cartridge
dims:
pitch: "​Space Invaders with only one invader."
ps: "​Space Invader is a mod of the Atari game Space Invaders which has been turned
  into Space Invader (note: its no longer plural…thus the white out over the last
  “s” on the cartridge) –&gt; all the invaders have been erased except one. This makes
  the game impossible to play, as the invader inherits bullets from all the others.
  The average game lasts about 1 minute. Good luck! Don’t forget 2 download the ROM
  below. "
