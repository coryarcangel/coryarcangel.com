pitch: "​Super Mario stuck on a cube."
ps: "​This one is an infinite loop of Mario stuck on a cube. A year later I cribbed
  this scene for the beginning of Paper Rad and I’s Super Mario Movie. I have hardly
  ever shown this, but it is one of my favourites. Also, of note, I lost the source
  code, ROM, and nearly everything associated with the project shortly after making
  it in 2003. In my defence, I had just turned 25, and well, just wasn’t very organised
  (my studio at this point was still under my loft bed). Anyway, sometime many years
  later, I found the actual finished version in a pile of old ROM chips. In 2013 -
  as I was long out of the 6502 game - I gave it 2 Todd Bailey / Andrew Reitano of
  Narrat1ve who sucked the data off of the ROM, and reconstructed the .NES emulator
  file. Thx again guys!&nbsp;"
