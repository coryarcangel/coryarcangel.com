pitch: "<p>​Goldberg Variation #1 re-constructed using Youtube vidz.</p>"
ps: "<p>​This was the first in a series of three different vidz I ended up making
  which tied together different utube videos using software I made called Gould Pro.
  2 b honest I was hoping for a meme hit! So why I made the first one dual channel
  I have no idea (aka, not really the utube format). The second, and third one ended
  up better in this respect. </p>"
