year: '2007'
display_year: '2007'
medium: Dual channel video
dims:
pitch: "​Goldberg Variation #1 re-constructed using Youtube vidz."
ps: "​This was the first in a series of three different vidz I ended up making which
  tied together different utube videos using software I made called Gould Pro. 2 b
  honest I was hoping for a meme hit! So why I made the first one dual channel I have
  no idea (aka, not really the utube format). The second, and third one ended up better
  in this respect. "
