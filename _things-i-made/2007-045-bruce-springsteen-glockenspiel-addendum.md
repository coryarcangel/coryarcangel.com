pitch:
ps: "​Cd’s given away with a mix version of my composition The Bruce Springsteen Born
  to Run Glockenspiel Addendum. When imported into iTunes, because of the song lengths,
  the CD get tagged incorrectly as Born To Run. Anyway,.....the idea was to kinda
  corrupt the grey market public archive of this record as the above mix tagged files
  would eventually get circulated as Bruce’s record. :)"
