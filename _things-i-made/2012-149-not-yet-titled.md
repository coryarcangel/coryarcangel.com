pitch: Live tele-performance of me watching TV (and having a glass of white wine).
ps: "â€‹This was a live performance where I watched TV in NYC, and broadcast it live
  to the Western Front in Vancouver (via Skype).I also had a glass of white wine somewhere
  along the way. Yes, that is Erin Brockovich in the still above. The idea here was
  to do just whatever I would have been doing anyway, except broadcast it across North
  America to an audience - the ultimate low stress / stay at home performance."
