pitch: "​Simon and Garfunkel DVD where chapter markers have been moved to places where
  one can see tension between the two."
ps: "<p>​This isn't exactly a video, but actually a modified DVD. The only difference
  between this DVD, and the one you can (or could) buy in stores, is that the chapter
  markers have been moved on this one to places where you can see Simon and Garfunkel
  bicker. So, unless you are forwarding between chapters (which normally would be
  placed at the beginning of songs), it looks pretty much like the store bought DVD.
  The only way I successfully figured out how to show this was in comedy clubs where
  I would play the DVD as it was projected and narrate as I forwarded it to my new
  chapter markers. It took me all summer to figure out how to re-program a DVD, and
  to this day this project is one of the stupider things I ever spent an insane amount
  of time and energy doing. Especially since it was virtually impossible to show in
  any traditional sense (hence comedy clubs).&nbsp; "
