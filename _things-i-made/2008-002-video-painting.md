pitch: "<p>​2 hour video improvisation made on an assortment of video tools.</p>"
ps: <p>​Video painting is a 2 hour (eeek!) long video edited onto a <i><b> unique</b></i>
  VHS cassette tape I made using various image generation technology I had lying around
  (Amiga Toaster, Video FX Ed/it machines, vidicon cameras, Final Cut, etc, etc, etc).
  It was edited down from about 14 hours of improvisation (aka just hitting random
  buttons). Below are some stills. To see it please check <a title="" href="http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=78231">this</a>
  place out cause they have the only tape.</p>
