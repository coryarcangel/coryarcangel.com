pitch: "​Just the road from a racing game."
ps: "​This is a simple mod I did of the old Japanese Famicom driving game F1 Racer.
  Basically I just took out the game, cars, etc, and left the road. pps – In case
  you are wondering, sometimes I also refer to this project as “Japanese Driving Game”
  (which is another non title), and it also seems to float around on the web bootlegged
  titled ‘F2′….check below for the ROM."
