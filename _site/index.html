    <p>Hello,</p>

<p>I’m Cory Arcangel ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Thanks for stopping by 2 my <em>temporary</em> site (old site(s) hit by malware :-/) So, anyway, Ill do my best to point you 2 some things I have been up to while I try to sort out the mess of my old site(s). 
First, of course, let me point you to some new things. <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/cory_arcangel/ai-generated-abs">Here</a> are some “rock hard abs” I generated by some deep learning magic w the good ppl at Buzzfeed. 
<a href="https://github.com/coryarcangel/chord-memory">Here</a> is a MAX Patch which will generate you some equal temperament compositions. 
You can hear an export in <a href="https://issueprojectroom.org/event/remind-me-tomorrow-cory-arcangel-hampus-lindwall-stine-janvin-roc-jim%C3%A9nez-de-cisneros-evol">this</a> hour+ pipe organ concert performed entirely inside an iphone @ Issue Project Room, &amp; co-curated by myself w/ <a href="http://www.hampuslindwall.com/">Hampus Lindwall</a>. 
Also — &amp; this is a big one — <a href="https://rodeo.computer/">here</a> is a machine learning video game playing computer I spent 4 years working on with a team of programmers, … which at the moment can “play” ish Kim Kardashian:HOLLYWOOD, &amp; <a href="https://www.greenenaftaligallery.com/exhibitions/cory-arcangel">here</a> are some pics of it performing @ Greene Naftali Gallery. 
So, that’s some new stuff. 
Now for some middle things? 
I worked with my friend Tony Conrad to publish his <a href="http://http://musicandthemindofthe.world/">500+ hour long piano composition Music &amp; the Mind of the World</a>. 
&amp; <a href="https://www.warhol.org/exhibition/warhol-and-the-amiga/">here</a> r some Warhol Amiga images I helped find with many other ppl. 
&amp; maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndQsEjFisIs&amp;list=PLIVciZ6unaZT1rywkXy290ijIIUgEyYFr">more stupid video game stuff is your thing</a>? 
&amp; if you have visited this site 4 some old stuff, 
maybe you would like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIVciZ6unaZSRQMwlT0jauk6H8l64G6oU">cats playing Schoenberg</a>, 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QjTPA-Ib9E&amp;t=3s">my most seen “artwork” ever</a>, 
&amp; some more video game stuff, including, <a href="https://github.com/coryarcangel/Super-Mario-Clouds/">Super Mario Clouds</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/coryarcangel/Totally-Fucked">Totally Fucked</a>, 
&amp; <a href="https://github.com/coryarcangel/I-Shot-&amp;y-Warhol">I Shot Andy Warhol</a>. 
&amp; last but not least, I am on Youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/coryarcangel">here</a>, 
but also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_LfMr7ffUG9q5M3UuxmF0Q">here</a>, 
&amp; also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYBrqFro8YOq5IPGSoVQycg">here</a>. 
&amp; Im on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/cory_arcangel">here</a>, &amp; prolly more places I forgot. 
&amp; Im ALWAYS on Are.na. I can recommend <a href="https://www.are.na/cory-arcangel/nice-pics">nice pics</a> (updated weekly!), 
<a href="https://www.are.na/cory-arcangel/wish-i-made-this">Wish I Made This</a>, 
&amp; here’s <a href="https://www.are.na/the-year-in-the-internet/channels?sort=UPDATED_AT">The Year in the Internet, 2020</a>, put together with Michael Bell Smith. 
&amp; if none of this is helpful, I have taken a sec to can my old site <a href="https://conifer.rhizome.org/cory_arcangel/coryarcangelcom/20211205113448/https://coryarcangel.com/">here</a>!</p>
