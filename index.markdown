Hello, 

I'm Cory Arcangel ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Thanks for stopping by 2 my *temporary* site (old site(s) hit by malware :-/) So, anyway, Ill do my best to point you 2 some things I have been up to while I try to sort out the mess of my old site(s). 
First, of course, let me point you to some new things. [Here](https://www.buzzfeed.com/cory_arcangel/ai-generated-abs) are some "rock hard abs" I generated by some deep learning magic w the good ppl at Buzzfeed. 
[Here](https://github.com/coryarcangel/chord-memory) is a MAX Patch which will generate you some equal temperament compositions. 
You can hear an export in [this](https://issueprojectroom.org/event/remind-me-tomorrow-cory-arcangel-hampus-lindwall-stine-janvin-roc-jim%C3%A9nez-de-cisneros-evol) hour+ pipe organ concert performed entirely inside an iphone @ Issue Project Room, & co-curated by myself w/ [Hampus Lindwall](http://www.hampuslindwall.com/). 
Also — & this is a big one — [here](https://rodeo.computer/) is a machine learning video game playing computer I spent 4 years working on with a team of programmers, ... which at the moment can "play" ish Kim Kardashian:HOLLYWOOD, & [here](https://www.greenenaftaligallery.com/exhibitions/cory-arcangel) are some pics of it performing @ Greene Naftali Gallery. 
So, that's some new stuff. 
Now for some middle things? 
I worked with my friend Tony Conrad to publish his [500+ hour long piano composition Music & the Mind of the World](http://http://musicandthemindofthe.world/). 
& [here](https://www.warhol.org/exhibition/warhol-and-the-amiga/) r some Warhol Amiga images I helped find with many other ppl. 
& maybe [more stupid video game stuff is your thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndQsEjFisIs&list=PLIVciZ6unaZT1rywkXy290ijIIUgEyYFr)? 
& if you have visited this site 4 some old stuff, 
maybe you would like [cats playing Schoenberg](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIVciZ6unaZSRQMwlT0jauk6H8l64G6oU), 
[my most seen "artwork" ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QjTPA-Ib9E&t=3s), 
& some more video game stuff, including, [Super Mario Clouds](https://github.com/coryarcangel/Super-Mario-Clouds/), 
[Totally Fucked](https://github.com/coryarcangel/Totally-Fucked), 
& [I Shot Andy Warhol](https://github.com/coryarcangel/I-Shot-&y-Warhol). 
& last but not least, I am on Youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/coryarcangel), 
but also [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_LfMr7ffUG9q5M3UuxmF0Q), 
& also [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYBrqFro8YOq5IPGSoVQycg). 
& Im on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/cory_arcangel), & prolly more places I forgot. 
& Im ALWAYS on Are.na. I can recommend [nice pics](https://www.are.na/cory-arcangel/nice-pics) (updated weekly!), 
[Wish I Made This](https://www.are.na/cory-arcangel/wish-i-made-this), 
& here's [The Year in the Internet, 2020](https://www.are.na/the-year-in-the-internet/channels?sort=UPDATED_AT), put together with Michael Bell Smith. 
& if none of this is helpful, I have taken a sec to can my old site [here](https://conifer.rhizome.org/cory_arcangel/coryarcangelcom/20211205113448/https://coryarcangel.com/)!
